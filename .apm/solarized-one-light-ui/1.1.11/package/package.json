That unavailable in solarized colorspace, and I think it is not so pretty. :)\n\n### Install\n\nUse either **Atom's** `Settings -> Install` interface, or:\n```sh\n$ apm install solarized-one-light-ui\n```\n\n### Settings\n\nIn the theme settings you can switch between 3 __Layout Modes__:\n\n1. `Auto` (default) - In Auto mode, the UI and font size will automatically change based on the window size.\n2. `Compact` - The UI stays compact to leave more space for the editor.\n3. `Spacious` - The UI is expanded, giving some breathing room.\n\nAs well as change the __Font Size__ to scale the whole UI up or down.\n\n### Customize\n\nIt's also possible to resize only certain areas by adding the following to your `styles.less` (Use the DevTools to find the right selectors):\n\n```css\n.theme-solarized-one-light-ui {\n  .tab-bar { font-size: 18px; }\n  .tree-view { font-size: 14px; }\n  .status-bar { font-size: 12px; }\n}\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/senki/solarized-one-light-ui/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/senki/solarized-one-light-ui#readme","_id":"solarized-one-light-ui@1.1.11","_shasum":"f0ad077072850d24a1d23db410482d136aae0981","_resolved":"file:../d-116621-43733-5tdzlf/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116621-43733-5tdzlf/package.tgz"}
